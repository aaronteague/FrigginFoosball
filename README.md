#Friggin Foosball(2015)

* Uses C++ and Lua
* Built on gameplay3D framework
* Originally built for a game contest
* Challenging AI and fun voice overs

In the middle of 2015, there was a game creation contest that would feature prizes for various achievements.  As a test to myself, I hammered together a remake of my very first  game.   I built this one from the ground up and gave it a decent AI, silly characters, and voice overs from me as the announcer.  After the contest ended, I kept work on the game and eventually published it on mobile.
